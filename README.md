## 🧭 Project Phases

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   Detailed analysis of the dataset to understand variable types, descriptive stats, and select the most relevant information for later stages.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   Standardized column names, corrected typos, and removed redundancies. Missing values were handled using client input or statistical methods. The cleaned dataset was exported as a CSV for visualization.

3. **Database Design and Data Insertion:**

   * Defined database structure: tables, relationships, primary and foreign keys.
   * Created the database using Python and MySQL Workbench.
   * Inserted initial employee records into the database.

4. **ETL Creation (Automated Data Load & Transformation):**
   Automated the loading and transformation process to keep the relational database consistently updated and prepared for analysis.

5. **Results Reporting (with Python Visualizations):**
   Delivered an in-depth report with visualizations to help ABC Corporation understand current trends and make informed decisions.

6. **Presentation:**
   Final results were presented using Canva, with a soft, elegant color palette inspired by Japanese Sakura aesthetics.
